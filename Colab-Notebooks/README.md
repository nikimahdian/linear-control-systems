"# Colab Notebooks" 

## 📖 Overview
This repository contains an assignment on **Control Systems**, where we explore key frequency-domain analysis techniques for linear control systems. The assignment includes:

- 📊 **Bode Plot**: Understanding frequency response and stability.
- 🔄 **Nyquist Plot**: Determining system stability using contour mapping.
- 📈 **Root Locus**: Analyzing pole movement as gain varies.
- 📏 **Phase Margin & Gain Margin Calculation**: Evaluating system stability.
